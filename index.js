/*

for Top Hits page
use an API + manipulate CSS to create numbered lists for today's hits, etc

for discography search
create a form
then form.onsubmit to fetch from API the discography of the user's input
our weather app assignment will be very helpful with this part

and we have to use localstore somewhere (going to have to relearn that one!)
